                <p id="intro">It's pie season... are you ready? Years ago I started making changes to 
                    my mom's apple pie recipe, just to experiment, and eventually got to the
                    point where I stopped experimenting because I arrived at something I really
                    love (and other people seem to like pretty well too).</p>

                            necessary to keep slices from falling off the pile. Place thin pats of

                        apples (like Honeycrisp), and add a bag of fresh cranberries. And maybe
